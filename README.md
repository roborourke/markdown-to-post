markdown-to-post
================

Plugin to convert a README.md markdown (including github flavoured) to a wp post (in development)

## TODO

* Post edit UI (URL field for markdown file to get, non raw github URL handling, github URL context handling)
* Shortcode to output markdown HTML to?
* Media Button / TinyMCE plugin to insert markdown as HTML from any source anywhere in a post?
* Support for authoring in markdown? (loads of plugins to do this already, don't know if they use github API)
* Styling for github highlighted code
* Cron job refresh? Refresh button
* More github API niceness like pulling in list of repos, found markdown files? Probably not worth it.

## Comments etc...

If you came across this and are actually interested in it becoming a proper plugin review the above ideas in the TODO
list and add your own suggestions or confirm some of the ideas that might be worth doing in the issues on this repo.

Thanks!
